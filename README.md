## What is Python - From python.org

```xml

Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. 
Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, 
make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting 
or glue language to connect existing components together. 

Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and 
therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and 
packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter 
and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge 
for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

List Data Structure: 
marks = [23, 56, 67]

Set Data Structure: 
# Does not allow duplicates (its ignored) and does not maintain order. 
marks = {23, 56, 67}

Dictionary:
occurances = dict(a=5, b=6, c=8)

Tuples:
# Immutable sequence of values
person = ('Alice', 30, 'USA')
