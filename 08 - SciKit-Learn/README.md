# Scikit-learn (sklearn)

## Introduction
```xml 
Scikit-Learn, also referred to as sklearn, is an open-source Python machine learning library.

It's built on top on NumPy (Python library for numerical computing) 
and Matplotlib (Python library for data visualization).

Although the fields of data science and machine learning are vast, the main goal is 
finding patterns within data and then using those patterns to make predictions.
And there are certain categories which a majority of problems fall into.

Classification problem: 
----------------------
If you're trying to create a machine learning model to predict whether 
an email is spam and or not spam, you're working on a classification problem 
(whether something is one thing or another).

Regression problem: 
------------------
If you're trying to create a machine learning model to predict the price of houses 
given their characteristics, you're working on a regression problem (predicting a number).

Clustering problem: 
------------------
If you're trying to get a machine learning algorithm to group together similar samples 
(that you don't necessarily know which should go together), 
you're working on a clustering problem.

Once you know what kind of problem you're working on, 
there are also similar steps you'll take for each.

Steps like splitting the data into different sets, 
one for your machine learning algorithms to learn on (the training set) 
and another to test them on (the testing set).

Choosing a machine learning model and then evaluating whether 
or not your model has learned anything.

Scikit-Learn offers Python implementations for doing all of these kinds of tasks 
(from preparing data to modelling data). 
Saving you from having to build them from scratch.

## Scikit-learn workflow 
```xml 
1. Getting the data ready
2. Choosing the right maching learning estimator/aglorithm/model for your problem
3. Fitting your chosen machine learning model to data and using it to make a prediction
4. Evaluting a machine learning model
5. Improving predictions through experimentation (hyperparameter tuning)
6. Saving and loading a pretrained model
7. Putting it all together in a pipeline
