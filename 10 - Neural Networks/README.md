# Neural Networks

## Introduction
```xml 
What is TensorFlow: 
------------------
TensorFlow is a software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. 
It can be used across a range of tasks, but is used mainly for training and 
inference of neural networks. It is one of the most popular deep learning frameworks, 
alongside others such as PyTorch and PaddlePaddle - Wikipedia 

Why do we use TensorFlow:
------------------------
We use TensorFlow primarily for building and deploying machine learning (ML) 
and deep learning models. Here’s why it's widely used:

1. Scalability & Performance: 
Efficient computation: Uses optimized operations with 
support for GPUs, TPUs, and distributed computing.
Scalable deployment: Works from mobile devices (TensorFlow Lite) 
to large-scale distributed systems (TensorFlow Serving).

2. Flexibility & Ease of Use: 
Multi-language support: Primarily Python, 
but also supports C++, Java, and Go.
Multiple APIs: High-level APIs like Keras for quick prototyping 
and low-level APIs for custom model development.

3. Strong Ecosystem & Tooling: 
TensorFlow Extended (TFX): A full ML pipeline framework for 
production-ready applications.
TensorBoard: Visualization tools for debugging and optimizing models.
TF Lite & TF.js: Deploy models on mobile, edge devices, or in-browser.

4. Industry Adoption & Community Support: 
Developed by Google and widely adopted across industries, 
making it well-documented with strong community support.

5. Support for Advanced ML & DL Features: 
Pre-trained models & transfer learning.
Reinforcement learning, generative models, and graph-based computations.
Auto-differentiation and gradient-based optimization.

What is neural network:
----------------------
A neural network is a method in artificial intelligence (AI) that teaches 
computers to process data in a way that is inspired by the human brain. 
It is a type of machine learning (ML) process, called deep learning, 
that uses interconnected nodes or neurons in a layered structure that 
resembles the human brain. - Oxford Dictionary

What is deep learning:
----------------------
Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks 
to learn from data. Artificial neural networks are inspired by the human brain, 
and they can be used to solve a wide variety of problems, 
including image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
- Oxford Dictionary

What kind of object detection problems are there:
-------------------------------------------------
1. Classification
Predicting a category or class label from given input data.
Example Use Cases:
Image classification (e.g., detecting cats vs. dogs in images).
Spam detection (classifying emails as spam or not).
Sentiment analysis (classifying text as positive, negative, or neutral).
Common Models: CNNs for images, RNNs/Transformers for text, and MLPs for tabular data.

2. Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq)
Mapping an input sequence to an output sequence of different or the same length.
Example Use Cases:
Machine translation (e.g., English to French translation).
Speech-to-text (converting audio into transcribed text).
Chatbots and conversational AI (generating responses based on input text).
Common Models: LSTMs, GRUs, Transformer-based models (like T5, GPT, BERT).

3. Object Detection
Identifying and localizing multiple objects within an image or video frame.
Example Use Cases:
Autonomous driving (detecting pedestrians, vehicles, and traffic signs).
Security surveillance (detecting suspicious activities or intruders).
Medical imaging (detecting tumors in X-ray/MRI scans).
Common Models: Faster R-CNN, YOLO, SSD, EfficientDet

What is Transfer Learning
-------------------------
Transfer learning is a deep learning technique where a pre-trained model 
(trained on a large dataset) is fine-tuned or adapted for a different but 
related task. Instead of training a model from scratch, 
we reuse learned features from a previously trained network.

Why Use Transfer Learning
-------------------------
Faster Training – Pre-trained models already have learned general features, 
reducing the need for extensive training.
Less Data Requirement – Since the model has prior knowledge, 
we can achieve good results even with a small dataset.
Improved Performance – Leveraging knowledge from large datasets helps in 
achieving better accuracy, especially in domains with limited data.
Efficient Use of Resources – Saves computational power and time compared 
to training deep models from scratch.

Example Use Cases
Image classification using pre-trained CNNs (e.g., ResNet, VGG, MobileNet).
NLP tasks like sentiment analysis using transformer models (e.g., BERT, GPT).
Medical imaging, where pre-trained models on general images are fine-tuned for specific diseases.

## Working with TensorFlow on Google Colab 
```xml 
# import tensorflow
import tensorflow as tf
# Print version of TensorFlow
print ("TensorFlow version : " + tf.__version__)


import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

print("TF version:", tf.__version__)
print("Hub version:", hub.__version__)

# Check for GPU
print("GPU", "available (YESS!!!!)" if tf.config.list_physical_devices("GPU") else "not available :(")

# This will output result as: (may vary from time to time)
TF version: 2.18.0
Hub version: 0.16.1
GPU not available :(

# Adding a GPU to TensorFlow
By default Colab runs on a computer located on Google's servers which doesn't have a GPU attached to it.
But we can fix this going to runtime and then changing the runtime type:

Go to Runtime.
Click "Change runtime type".
Where it says "Hardware accelerator", choose "GPU" (don't worry about TPU for now but feel free to research them).
Click save.
The runtime will be restarted to activate the new hardware, so you'll have to rerun the above cells.
If the steps have worked you should see a print out saying "GPU available".

# Google Colab Tutorial - This is a notebook by itself which can be copied 
and run in our environment or directly connected to a runtime by clicking the runtime button
on the right side (top)
https://colab.research.google.com/

# TensorFlow with GPU enabled (comparision with CPU)
https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/gpu.ipynb
Run the TensorFlow speedup on GPU relative to CPU section
but before running, connect it to a hosted runtime and add GPU.

```

## Getting data ready to work inside TensorFlow 
```xml 
# Running this cell will provide you with a token to link your drive to this notebook
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')


# Checkout the labels of our data 
import pandas as pd
labels_csv = pd.read_csv("/<path-to-file>/labels.csv")
print(labels_csv.describe())
print(labels_csv.head())

# Display the breed column 
labels_csv["breed"]
# How many images are there of each breed?
labels_csv["breed"].value_counts();
# Plot it to a graph
labels_csv["breed"].value_counts().plot.bar(figsize=(20, 10));
# Calculate mean 
print(labels_csv["breed"].value_counts().mean())
# Calculate median
print(labels_csv["breed"].value_counts().median())

```

## Preparing the images
```xml 
# Let's check out one of the images.
from IPython.display import display, Image
Image("<path-to-files>/000bec180eb18c7604dcecc8fe0dba07.jpg")

# Create pathnames from image ID's
filenames = ["/content/drive/MyDrive/AI Project/train/" + fname + ".jpg" for fname in labels_csv["id"]]
# Check the first 10 filenames
filenames[:10]

# Now we've got a list of all the filenames from the ID column of labels_csv, 
# we can compare it to the number of files in our training data directory 
# to see if they line up.
# Check whether number of filenames matches number of actual image files
import os
if len(os.listdir("<path-to-files>")) == len(filenames):
  print("Filenames match actual amount of files!")
else:
  print("Filenames do not match actual amount of files, check the target directory.")

# Visualizing directly from a filepath.
# Check an image directly from a filepath
Image(filenames[9000])

```

## Convert labels into numbers
```xml 
# We'll take them from labels_csv and turn them into a NumPy array.
import numpy as np
labels = labels_csv["breed"].to_numpy() # convert labels column to NumPy array
labels[:10]

# See if number of labels matches the number of filenames
if len(labels) == len(filenames):
  print("Number of labels matches number of filenames!")
else:
  print("Number of labels does not match number of filenames, check data directories.")

# Find the unique label values
unique_breeds = np.unique(labels)
len(unique_breeds)

# Example: Turn one label into an array of booleans
print(labels[0])
labels[0] == unique_breeds # use comparison operator to create boolean array

# Turn every label into a boolean array
boolean_labels = [label == np.array(unique_breeds) for label in labels]
boolean_labels[:2]

len(boolean_labels)

# Example: Turning a boolean array into integers
print(labels[0]) # original label
print(np.where(unique_breeds == labels[0])[0][0]) # index where label occurs
print(boolean_labels[0].argmax()) # index where label occurs in boolean array
print(boolean_labels[0].astype(int)) # there will be a 1 where the sample label occurs

# List one more time to check
boolean_labels[:2]
filenames[:10]

```

##  Creating our own validation set
```xml 
Since the dataset from Kaggle doesn't come with a validation set 
(a split of the data we can test our model on before making final predicitons on the test set), 
let's make one.
We could use Scikit-Learn's train_test_split function or 
we could simply make manual splits of the data.

For accessibility later, let's save our filenames variable to X (data) and 
our labels to y.
# Setup X & y variables
X = filenames
y = boolean_labels

Since we're working with 10,000+ images, it's a good idea to work with a portion of them 
to make sure things are working before training on them all.

This is because computing with 10,000+ images could take a fairly long time. 
And our goal when working through machine learning projects is to reduce the time between experiments.

Let's start experimenting with 1000 and increase it as we need.

# Set number of images to use for experimenting
NUM_IMAGES = 1000 #@param {type:"slider", min:1000, max:10000, step:1000}
NUM_IMAGES

Now let's split our data into training and validation sets. 
We'll use and 80/20 split (80% training data, 20% validation data).

# Import train_test_split from Scikit-Learn
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split them into training and validation using NUM_IMAGES 
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X[:NUM_IMAGES],
                                                  y[:NUM_IMAGES], 
                                                  test_size=0.2,
                                                  random_state=42)

len(X_train), len(y_train), len(X_val), len(y_val)

# Check out the training data (image file paths and labels)
X_train[:5], y_train[:2]

```

## Preprocessing images (turning images into Tensors)
```xml
Preprocessing Images (turning images into Tensors)
To preprocess our images into Tensors we're going to write a function which does a few things:
1. Take an image filepath as input
2. Use TensorFlow to read the file and save it to a variable, image
3. Turn our image (a jpg) into Tensors
4. Normalize our image (convert color channel values from from 0-255 to 0-1).
5. Resize the image to be a shape of (224, 224)
6. Return the modified image

# Convert image to NumPy array
from matplotlib.pyplot import imread
image = imread(filenames[42])
image.shape

image.max(), image.min()

image[:2]

# turn image into a tensor
tf.constant(image)[:2]


Now we've seen what an image looks like as a Tensor, 
let's make a function to preprocess them.

We'll create a function to:

1. Take an image filepath as input
2. Use TensorFlow to read the file and save it to a variable, image
3. Turn our image (a jpg) into Tensors
4. Normalize our image (convert color channel values from from 0-255 to 0-1).
5. Resize the image to be a shape of (224, 224)
6. Return the modified image

More information on loading images in TensorFlow can be seen here: 
https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/images

# Define image size
IMG_SIZE = 224

# Create a function for preprocessing images
def process_image(image_path, img_size=IMG_SIZE):
  """
  Takes an image file path and turns the image into a Tensor.
  """
  # Read in an image file
  image = tf.io.read_file(image_path)
  # Turn the jpeg image into numerical Tensor with 3 colour channels (Red, Green, Blue)
  image = tf.image.decode_jpeg(image, channels=3)
  # Convert the colour channel values from 0-255 to 0-1 values
  image = tf.image.convert_image_dtype(image, tf.float32)
  # Resize the image to our desired value (224, 224)
  image = tf.image.resize(image, size=[IMG_SIZE, IMG_SIZE])

  return image

```


## Turning our data into batches
```xml
Turning our data into batches
Why turn our data into batches?

Let's say you're trying to process 10,000+ images in one go... 
they all might not fit into memory.

So that's why we do about 32 (this is the batch size) images at a time 
(you can manually adjust the batch size if need be).

In order to use TensorFlow effectively, we need our data in the form of 
Tensor tuples which look like this: (image, label).

# Create a simple function to return a tuple (image, label)
def get_image_label(image_path, label):
  """
  Takes an image file path name and the assosciated label,
  processes the image and reutrns a typle of (image, label).
  """
  image = process_image(image_path)
  return image, label

# Demo of the above
(process_image(X[42]), tf.constant(y[42]))



# Define the batch size, 32 is a good start
BATCH_SIZE = 32

# Create a function to turn data into batches
def create_data_batches(X, y=None, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE, valid_data=False, test_data=False):
  """
  Creates batches of data out of image (X) and label (y) pairs.
  Shuffles the data if it's training data but doesn't shuffle if it's validation data.
  Also accepts test data as input (no labels).
  """
  # If the data is a test dataset, we probably don't have have labels
  if test_data:
    print("Creating test data batches...")
    data = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((tf.constant(X))) # only filepaths (no labels)
    data_batch = data.map(process_image).batch(BATCH_SIZE)
    return data_batch
  
  # If the data is a valid dataset, we don't need to shuffle it
  elif valid_data:
    print("Creating validation data batches...")
    data = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((tf.constant(X), # filepaths
                                               tf.constant(y))) # labels
    data_batch = data.map(get_image_label).batch(BATCH_SIZE)
    return data_batch

  else:
    print("Creating training data batches...")
    # Turn filepaths and labels into Tensors
    data = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((tf.constant(X),
                                               tf.constant(y)))
    # Shuffling pathnames and labels before mapping image processor function is faster than shuffling images
    data = data.shuffle(buffer_size=len(X))

    # Create (image, label) tuples (this also turns the iamge path into a preprocessed image)
    data = data.map(get_image_label)

    # Turn the training data into batches
    data_batch = data.batch(BATCH_SIZE)
  return data_batch


# Create training and validation data batches
train_data = create_data_batches(X_train, y_train)
val_data = create_data_batches(X_val, y_val, valid_data=True)

# Check out the different attributes of our data batches
train_data.element_spec, val_data.element_spec

```


## Visualizing Data Batches
```xml

Our data is now in batches, however, these can be a little hard to understand/comprehend, 
let's visualize them!


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a function for viewing images in a data batch
def show_25_images(images, labels):
  """
  Displays a plot of 25 images and their labels from a data batch.
  """
  # Setup the figure
  plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
  # Loop through 25 (for displaying 25 images)
  for i in range(25):
    # Create subplots (5 rows, 5 columns)
    ax = plt.subplot(5, 5, i+1)
    # Display an image 
    plt.imshow(images[i])
    # Add the image label as the title
    plt.title(unique_breeds[labels[i].argmax()])
    # Turn the grid lines off
    plt.axis("off")


train_data

# # Now let's visualize the data in a training batch
train_images, train_labels = next(train_data.as_numpy_iterator())
show_25_images(train_images, train_labels)


# # Now let's visualize our validation set
val_images, val_labels = next(val_data.as_numpy_iterator())
show_25_images(val_images, val_labels)
```

## Building a model
```xml
Before we build a model, there are a few things we need to define:

The input shape (our images shape, in the form of Tensors) to our model.
The output shape (image labels, in the form of Tensors) of our model.
The URL of the model we want to use from TensorFlow Hub - 
https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_130_224/classification/4

IMG_SIZE

# Setup input shape to the model
INPUT_SHAPE = [None, IMG_SIZE, IMG_SIZE, 3] # batch, height, width, colour channels

# Setup output shape of our model
OUTPUT_SHAPE = len(unique_breeds)

# Setup model URL from TensorFlow Hub
MODEL_URL = "https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_130_224/classification/4"

INPUT_SHAPE


Now we've got our inputs, outputs and model ready to go. 
Let's put them together into a Keras deep learning model!

Knowing this, let's create a function which:

* Takes the input shape, output shape and the model we've chosen as parameters.
* Defines the layers in a Keras model in sequential fashion (do this first, then this, then that).
* Compiles the model (says it should be evaluated and improved).
* Builds the model (tells the model the input shape it'll be getting).
* Returns the model.

All of these steps can be found here: https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/overview

# Create a function which builds a Keras model
def create_model(input_shape=INPUT_SHAPE, output_shape=OUTPUT_SHAPE, model_url=MODEL_URL):
  print("Building model with:", MODEL_URL)

  # Setup the model layers
  model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    hub.KerasLayer(MODEL_URL), # Layer 1 (input layer)
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=OUTPUT_SHAPE,
                          activation="softmax") # Layer 2 (output layer)
  ])

  # Compile the model
  model.compile(
      loss=tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy(),
      optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(),
      metrics=["accuracy"]
  )

  # Build the model
  model.build(INPUT_SHAPE)

  return model

model = create_model()
model.summary()


```
