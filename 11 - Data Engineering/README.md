### What is data? 
Data is a collection of facts, numbers, words, observations or other useful information. 
Through data processing and data analysis, organizations transform raw data points into 
valuable insights that improve decision-making and drive better business outcomes.

### Structured data
Structured data is data that has a standardized format for efficient access by software 
and humans alike. It is typically tabular with rows and columns that clearly define data 
attributes. Computers can effectively process structured data for insights due to its 
quantitative nature.
* Data that contains rows and columns -> RDBMS
