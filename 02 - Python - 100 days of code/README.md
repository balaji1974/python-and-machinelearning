## Install Python and Setup Course
```xml
Step 1
Download and install Python to your computer. 
Head over to the official Python website to download the latest version 
of Python for your computer system. Then complete the installation.

Make sure you tick the box to Add to PATH / Add to Environment Variables. 
You will also need tcl/tk later in the course, 
so a Custom install gives you access to all of these settings.
